Simple Hangman

[----Purpose----]

A small and simple game to have fun and enjoy yourself.

[----Reason----]

I needed an excuse to publish a C# program. I've been using C# for a while but most of the programs I've made aren't intented for public use.

[---Misc.---]

Note: If there are any bugs/issue please let me know. Faster versions of hangman are avaliable on this website; this one is not as effecient as others.

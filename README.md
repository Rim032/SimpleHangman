**Simple Hangman*

[----Purpose----]

A small and simple game to have fun and enjoy yourself.

[----Reason----]

I needed an excuse to publish a C# program. I've been using C# in a while but most of the programs I've made aren't intented for public use.

Note: If there are any bugs/issue please let me know.
